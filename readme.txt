== Installation ==
1.	Install the plugin either by uploading it via FTP or by using the 'Add Plugin' function of WordPress.
2.	Activate the plugin at the 'Plugins' tab.
3.	Visit http://www.getpaycall.com/ and chose a registration method.
4.	Setup your profile.
7.	Connect your PAYCALL account with your profiles in Wordpress under 'PAYCALL Buttons > Add New'. These profiles can then be used directly in the WYSIWYG-Editor or under 'Appearance > Widgets'.

If you cannot connect your account, please make sure php5-curl is installed on your server or ask your site's host to do so. 
	
Unfortunatelly, there is an incompatibility with the SiteOrigin Page Builder plugin - if you need to use that, you can still integrate your Call-Me Button directly into the HTML of your site.
